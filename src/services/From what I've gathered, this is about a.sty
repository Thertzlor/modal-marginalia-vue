From what I've gathered, this is about a boy named Mammoth who, along with his friend, the digidestined (that's not really how you say it) save the world from being sucked into the computer game and find out that one of their friends is a secret agent for the IRS.

The problem is, that while they are going through this, they have to be in the game, so they can save it from another virus, which is supposed to make everybody go insane and commit suicide, because they want the game to keep playing.

I would also like to know if the "secret agent" is just the guy that gets paid by the IRS to stop crime, or if he has superpowers or something.

Edit:
Okay, I've watched up to episode 14 now, and I think I have the whole plot sorted out.

They are going through the game to stop a virus from killing all the kids and people in Japan. There seems to be some confusion between the US government and the Japanese government about who owns the game and whether or not it's OK to just let it keep on running.

It was a beautiful, warm, sunny day. You were sitting on the porch of your little blue house with a cup of coffee in hand. The air was fresh and the smell of grass tickled your nose. Somewhere far off you could hear the gentle humming of a car.

Your mind turned to that thing from before. Your friend Aiko had told you something strange about that one time you met her family's neighbors. That they were the same as yours, but some of them didn't really look like them. One of them looked just like a pig! That's impossible, right? They would have noticed it, right? No, not necessarily, she'd said, because...

"You can get away with anything if you are willing to pay for it."

That's what she'd said. What did that even mean? How much would you have to pay to become a different person?



A season of Digimon about  tax fraud

Re: Digital Monster X - A Season Of Digimon is the first season in a new series of books that re-explore the Digimon world and have a very similar format to the Digimon Tamers: Digital Stones.

The reason this is not just another Digimon story is because it will revolve around the idea of "tax fraud", as there are only 12 months in the year and everyone is paying taxes for 12 months of the year when they actually only owe taxes for 6 months of the year. It will be about Sora's and his friend's adventures solving mysteries that center around the fact that they have "stolen" a year's worth of taxes. This theme will tie in with all geographical locations mentioned in the first half of the series and all main characters appearing in both seasons, as well as other supporting cast members.

In the world of Digimon, there is one day when all humans get up before dawn, put on a black robe, and travel to the nearest town or city. That's the only time they can truly see what the other inhabitants of this world are really like. What lies beyond the city gates is another country, where people don't sleep but live their lives, eat food, and dream of a life away from work, school, and whatever else they do during the rest of the day. And it's at these times that you see the true personality of the local citizens.
When night falls, the human race once again melts into one homogeneous mass. They go to sleep in their houses, gather with family and friends, and spend their evenings looking for something to occupy them. There isn't any reason for a person to look different from the next one. The sun sets over the horizon, and the real world vanishes behind the windowpanes. It's during these dark hours that the "monsters" we all know and love emerge from the shadows. They're always there, every single night, as you are falling asleep.
